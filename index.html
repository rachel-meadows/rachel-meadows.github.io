            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>My background was originally in psychology. I was very interested in statistics and research, and did my honours thesis on how the visual system responds to fractal images.</p>
            <p>For the last three years, I've worked as the Operations Manager of an eLearning startup. My role involved a lot of talking to users and translating their needs into tickets for the programmers. Then I got interested in programming myself, so I did a few online courses and started researching the career. Finally, I took the plunge to quit my job and enrol in Dev Academy!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>My main goal is to get a job as a full-stack developer.</p>

        <div class="about-contents">
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>My key values are curiosity and adaptability, as you can read in my <a href="blog.html" target="_blank">core post</a>. [Some other words go here.]</p>
            <p>My dad has a saying he loves: "Be a rat in a maze". Meaning keep trying different things, scrabble around and double-back as much as needed in pursuit of your goals.</p>
            <p>My mum also has a good one: "Life is not a quiet river". Meaning accept some degree of rapids, and enjoy the smooth water when you can.</p>
            <p>Between the two of them, I think that's a pretty decent life philosophy.</p>
