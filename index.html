            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>My background was originally in psychology. I was mostly interested in statistics and research, and I did my honours thesis on how the visual system responds to fractal images.</p>
            <p>For the last three years, I've worked as the Operations Manager of an eLearning startup. My role involved a lot of talking to users and translating their needs into tickets for the programmers. Then I got interested in programming myself, so I did a few online courses and started researching the career. Finally, I took the plunge to quit my job and enrol in Dev Academy!</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>My main goal is to get a job as a full-stack developer.</p>

        <h2>My ethos</h2>
        <div class="main-content">
          <div class="about-text">
            <p>My key values are curiosity and adaptability, which you can read about more in <a href="blog.html" target="_blank">this core post</a>.</p>
            <p>A lot of my values I got from my parents, and there's a couple of proverbs from them that sum up how I live my life. My dad always says:</p>
            <quote class="quote">"Be a rat in a maze".</quote>
            <p>This is an challenge to keep trying different things, even though that might involve scrabbling around and doubling-back sometimes. It's a way of saying "be flexible, determined and efficient in pursuit of your goals".</p>
            <p>My mum also has a favourite proverb:</p>
            <quote class="quote">"Life is not a quiet river".</quote>
            <p>This means to accept that you can't control everything in life. Sometimes a set of rapids come out of nowhere, and all you can do is adapt â€” struggling against the current only tires you out. It also means to enjoy the smooth sailing when you can!</p>
            <p>Between these two worldviews, I think it's a pretty solid ideal; to stay oriented towards my goals without trying to control the uncontrollable.</p>
