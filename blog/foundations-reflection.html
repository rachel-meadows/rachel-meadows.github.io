                        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt as a result of the
                            core learning?</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>My #1 pick for the most valuable programming skill is learning to treat failure as
                                information about the world. It really helps me to know that 'something not
                                working' always has an underlying cause, and that the issue is lies in the gap between
                                the world as it <em>really</em> is and the world as I <em>think</em> it
                                is.</li>
                            <li>The reinforcement that 'skill comes from practice' has been really helpful, and I've
                                put more thought into how I structure each day to make sure I'm learning efficiently.
                            </li>
                            <li>I'm more confident that I'll be able to solve issues with enough time and different
                                problem-solving techniques.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>

                        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                        <p>Being able to understand and relate to others is important in any workplace. However, it
                            is especially important to programmers, because we will need to understand others' thought
                            processes, and clearly communicate our own, to build things that are scalable.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                        <p>There weren't any major surprises, but it was interesting to deconstruct my own assumptions
                            about what makes a 'good' programmer.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                        <p>Thinking about my own beliefs and attitudes through an objective lens.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                            learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                        <p>Technology changes, but people don't. Over the course of our careers we will need to learn
                            new languages, frameworks, and tools. We will also need to adapt to the different standards
                            and conventions of different workplaces. However, being
                            easy to get along with, a good communicator, and a self-aware and effective learner will
                            always be valuable.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                            have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                        <p>Honestly, in my heart of hearts I did start out feeling that way. I was happy to play along
                            because EDA has much more expertise than I do in teaching people to program, so I assumed
                            they had an reason beyond just learning the human skills necessary in any
                            workplace.
                        </p>
                        <p>Looking back, I now see that these are the traits that will modify the <em>rate</em> of skill
                            progression over time. Yes, spending 10 hours learning programming concepts instead of human
                            skills right now will put
                            your programming skills ahead. But over
                            the whole course of a career, the person who has trained their emotional
                            intelligence will have more mentorship opportunities, will persevere better in the face of
                            failure, and will have the self-awareness to mitigate their weaknesses. We have about
                            <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 hours</a> in our careers.
                            If the person who improves
                            their human skills learns just 1% more efficiently, they have saved 800 hours - well worth
                            the up-front 10 hour investment!
