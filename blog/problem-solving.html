                        <h3>"A time you got blocked on a simple problem"</h3>
                        <p>I've been doing a few coding exercises outside of this course to help me learn the JavaScript
                            syntax and expose myself to more concepts. My technique has been to do the questions
                            alongside a tutorial or textbook to understand the concept, then to do that same question
                            again the next day on my own.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/" target="_blank">One of these problems</a>
                            had me completed blocked today.
                            I knew the theory on how to solve it from learning the day before, and in the test
                            case my code worked perfectly, but it kept failing something in the full suite of tests.</p>
                        <p>The problem solving technique I used initially was to try to isolate the problem. I added a
                            <span class="code">console.log</span> for every substep of the calculation, then manually
                            worked out what the answer should have been at each point. I realised that the code was
                            continuing to iterate longer than it should have, in ways that sometimes gave the right
                            answer and sometimes didn't. I was feeling pretty frustrated at this point so took a few
                            deep breaths, and this helped me realise the structure I was using (a <span
                                  class="code">for</span>
                            loop) was completely wrong, as the way I'd set up the code would only work with a <span
                                  class="code">do-while</span> loop.
                        </p>
                        <p>What I learned from this is to start by working through each step of the problem from a
                            high-level view
                            - I spent nearly 30 minutes bogged down in implementation within the loop, but I
                            hadn't even thought to question the structure itself.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>"A time you solved a problem in an elegant way"</h3>
                        <p>I don't want to spoil the Sprint 4 content for anyone, so will stick to outside-the-course
                            examples. There was
                            <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-pair-sum-in-array/" target="_blank">one exercise</a>
                            I did manage to solve on my own, which was pretty cool. Basically the problem was to take a
                            list of numbers, then pair up all the numbers in a way that the largest sum of a
                            pair was kept as low as possible. I figured I could just sort the array of numbers (though I
                            did have to Google how to do this!), then take the smallest and the biggest
                            number and pair them, then the second-smallest and second-biggest, and so on.
                        </p>
                        <p>This was still a little frustrating at times as I ran into problems with syntax, but all in
                            all it felt way better because I could see the overarching 'point' of the program, so I was
                            confident it would work if I could just figure out all the substeps.</p>
                        <p>What I learned from this experience is that understanding what is going on in a program, and
                            <strong>why</strong>, is essential to getting it to work - but also is essential to staying
                            calm
                            and
                            motivated! I think it's shown me that if I don't fully understand
                            something at the start, I
                            shouldn't even touch the keyboard until I've actually worked what I'm doing. Otherwise I
                            waste time and get frustrated over implementation without making any real headway.
                        </p>
